# EstimateManager
A way to enter and generate estimate sheets.

This started from using PERT estimates for freelance work, and realized others could benefit from it's use. I also wanted to learn how VUE works a bit better.


### TODO:
- PDF generation still sucks. Can't see to find a format that is consistent, but everything but edge cases seems to work right now.
- Templates and styling
- Logo support
- Custom HTML header and footer for branding
- User profiles and manage multiple estimates
